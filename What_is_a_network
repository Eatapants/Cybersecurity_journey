Overview
Networking is the connection of multiple systems for communication and data transfer. From local Wi-Fi to the global Internet, everything functions as part of a network.

This module covered:
The concept of networks in both human and technical contexts
Differences between public and private networks
Device identification through IP and MAC addresses
How the Internet operates as a network of networks
Introductory network diagnostic tools like ping
Basics of IP spoofing through MAC address changes

Key Concepts
What Is a Network?
A network is a group of interconnected devices, from just two to billions. These include phones, laptops, IoT devices, traffic lights, and more. Networks can be private (e.g., LANs) or public (e.g., the Internet).

The Internet
The Internet is a massive mesh of smaller private networks connected through intermediary nodes like routers. It began with ARPANET in the 1960s and evolved into the modern World Wide Web in 1989.

Identifying Devices on a Network
IP Addresses
IP addresses are temporary identifiers for devices to communicate.

Private IP: Local network identification (e.g., 192.168.1.74)

Public IP: External network identification (e.g., 86.157.52.21)

MAC Addresses
MAC addresses are unique, hardcoded hardware identifiers for network interfaces (e.g., a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d). They can be spoofed to impersonate another device on the network.

Example: MAC spoofing can be used to bypass network restrictions, such as hotel Wi-Fi blocking based on MAC address.

Tools Used
Ping (ICMP)
Used to test connectivity and measure latency.
Example: ping 8.8.8.8
Sends ICMP Echo Request and receives Echo Reply packets.

Hands-on Labs Summary
MAC Spoofing Lab
Scenario: A hotel Wi-Fi blocks Bob’s MAC address.
Solution: Bob spoofs Alice’s MAC address to gain access.

Ping Lab
Task: Ping Google’s DNS server (8.8.8.8)
Result: Gathered round-trip time, packet loss, and latency metrics.

What I Learned
Networking is foundational to cybersecurity

Device identities (IP/MAC) are key to communication

Techniques like spoofing and packet inspection lay the groundwork for ethical hacking and defense

Tools like ping are essential for diagnosing connectivity issues
