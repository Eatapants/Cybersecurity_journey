Topics Covered
Security Operations Center (SOC)
Monitors network/systems for policy violations, intrusions, and vulnerabilities.

Responds to malicious events using tools like SIEM.
Leverages Threat Intelligence to anticipate adversary behavior.

Threat Intelligence
Collects and analyzes data to understand attackersâ€™ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
Helps predict and defend against specific threat actors (e.g., ransomware groups, nation-state actors).

Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
Digital Forensics
Analyzes file systems, memory, and logs to uncover traces of an attack.

Incident Response
Follows a 4-phase approach:
- Preparation
- Detection & Analysis
- Containment, Eradication & Recovery
- Post-Incident Review

Malware Analysis
Static Analysis: Study malicious code without executing it.
Dynamic Analysis: Run malware in a safe environment to observe behavior.
Explored common malware types: viruses, Trojans, ransomware.

Hands-On Component
Simulated a real-world SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system to:
Investigate login failures and suspicious IPs.
Identify and respond to alerts.
Extract flags to validate understanding.

Key Takeaways
Defensive security is proactive and reactive.
Continuous monitoring, structured response, and contextual threat understanding are essential.
Defensive roles (blue team) require both technical and analytical skills.
