Understanding Alerts in a SOC Environment
Overview:
This documentation outlines the core concepts, processes, and hands-on experience gained from completing the SOC Level 1 Alert Handling training room on TryHackMe. The focus is on understanding the lifecycle of an alert in a Security Operations Center (SOC), and how to properly triage, investigate, and resolve it using standard procedures and tools.

Learning Objectives:
Understand the concept and lifecycle of SOC alerts
Explore standard alert fields, statuses, and classifications
Learn how to prioritize and investigate alerts as an L1 analyst
Gain practical experience through hands-on triage simulations
Prepare for SOC Simulator and SAL1 certification

Prerequisites:
Understanding of network, Windows, and Linux attack techniques
Familiarity with SOC roles and workflows, especially L1 duties

Alert Lifecycle Overview:
Event Generation
A system event occurs (e.g., login, file access, network connection)
The event is logged by the OS, application, or security system
Log Collection & Processing
Logs are sent to a central solution such as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
Detection rules evaluate logs and generate alerts for suspicious activity

Alert Creation
Alerts highlight anomalies and threats
Allows SOC analysts to focus on key incidents instead of millions of logs

Alert Management Systems:
SIEM: Splunk ES, Elastic SIEM
EDR/NDR: Microsoft Defender, CrowdStrike
SOAR: Splunk SOAR, Cortex SOAR
ITSM/Ticketing: Jira, TheHive

Roles in Alert Triage:
SOC L1: First responder. Reviews and classifies alerts
SOC L2: Escalation point. Performs deeper analysis and remediation
SOC Engineer: Ensures data quality and alert visibility
SOC Manager: Oversees triage performance and coverage

Alert Properties:
Alert Time – When the alert was generated
Alert Name – Short description of the suspicious activity
Alert Severity – Risk level (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical)
Alert Status – Workflow stage (e.g., New, In Progress, Closed)
Alert Verdict – Final classification (True Positive, False Positive)
Alert Assignee – Analyst responsible for triaging
Alert Description – Explanation of alert logic and relevance
Alert Fields – Supporting data (hostname, user, commandline, etc.)

Alert Prioritization Strategy:
Filter Alerts – Take only alerts not currently being worked on
Sort by Severity – Handle Critical first, then High, Medium, Low
Sort by Time – Older alerts should be reviewed before newer ones

Alert Triage Process:
Initial Actions:
Assign alert to yourself
Set status to "In Progress"
Read and understand alert metadata and indicators

Investigation Steps:
Identify affected system/user
Understand the nature of the event
Check for supporting evidence (before/after event)
Use threat intelligence to validate findings

Final Actions:
Set Verdict (True/False Positive)
Add detailed comment supporting your conclusion
Close the alert in the system

Key Takeaways:
Alerts are a filtered view of raw events, designed to catch malicious activity
Triage process helps differentiate threats from noise
L1 analysts are critical in preventing breaches by acting on alerts effectively
Good alert management depends on teamwork, playbooks, and consistent procedures
