Overview
Penetration testing is the ethical practice of evaluating the security of computer systems, applications, or networks by simulating real-world attacks. These assessments are performed under agreed-upon legal boundaries and are essential for identifying and remediating vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them.
Cybersecurity is increasingly important across industries, from individual data protection to securing national infrastructure. With over 2,200 attacks reported daily (Security Magazine), ethical hacking is a necessary line of defense.

Key Concepts
What is Penetration Testing?
A penetration test is a simulated cyberattack, conducted with the permission of the system owner, to identify and mitigate security flaws. Testers use the same tools and techniques as real attackers, under strict legal and ethical guidelines.

Legal and Ethical Considerations
Legality: A penetration test must be authorized and clearly scoped. Unauthorized testing is illegal.

Rules of Engagement (ROE): A document outlining:
Permission: Legal consent to test
Scope: What systems are in or out of bounds
Rules: Techniques allowed or disallowed

Hacker Hat Categories
Hat Type	Description	Example
White Hat	Ethical hackers who operate within the law to help secure systems	Authorized penetration testers
Grey Hat	Hackers who act with good intent but may bypass legal boundaries	Taking down scam websites without permission
Black Hat	Malicious hackers who exploit systems for personal gain	Ransomware authors, data thieves

Pentesting Methodology
A practical pentesting methodology adapts to the context of the target system. While specific steps may vary, most engagements follow a general structure:

Information Gathering
Passive OSINT and research; no interaction with target systems.

Enumeration / Scanning
Identify open ports, services, and possible attack vectors.

Exploitation
Use known vulnerabilities or flaws to gain initial access.

Privilege Escalation
Increase access rights on a compromised system (horizontal or vertical).
Post-Exploitation
Pivot to additional hosts
Extract sensitive information
Cover tracks
Document findings for reporting

Testing Scopes
Black-Box Testing
The tester has no prior knowledge of the system. Simulates an external attack. Time-consuming due to extensive reconnaissance.

Grey-Box Testing
The tester has partial knowledge of the system (e.g., user credentials or documentation). Balances realism and efficiency.

White-Box Testing
Full access to system internals and source code. Usually conducted by developers. Guarantees complete coverage but is more time-intensive.

Industry Methodologies
OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)
Focuses on telecommunications, networking, and human factors.

Highly detailed and flexible, but challenging to adopt due to complexity.

OWASP
Community-driven framework for web application security.
Provides Top Ten vulnerability lists, testing techniques, and mitigation strategies.
Easy to adopt but limited to web applications.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (1.1)
Widely adopted in the U.S.
Provides standards and controls to improve cybersecurity posture.
Lacks detailed pentesting methodology and cloud-focused guidance.

NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)
UK-based, government-backed framework for critical infrastructure.
Focuses on system resiliency, identity, access control, and incident response.
Still relatively new and principle-based rather than procedural.

What I Learned
Penetration testing requires a deep understanding of technical, legal, and ethical considerations.
Methodologies must be tailored to specific environments (web, network, application).

Frameworks like OWASP and OSSTMM provide structured approaches for consistent, professional testing.

Ethical boundaries are as important as technical skill in cybersecurity.
