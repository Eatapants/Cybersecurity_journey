My first steps into the world of ethical hacking through the "Introduction to Offensive Security" room on TryHackMe. 
This beginner-friendly room simulates a vulnerable bank application ("FakeBank") and introduces key concepts used in offensive security.

Objective
The goal was to explore and exploit a web application by simulating how attackers might locate hidden functionality, 
such as admin panels or sensitive endpoints — using simple tools and techniques.

Tools Used
- Terminal (Command Line Interface) – Used to interact with hacking tools and issue commands.
- dirb – A brute-force tool used to find hidden directories or pages on a website.

Key Concepts Learned
- Reconnaissance and Information Gathering
- Learned how to identify hidden or sensitive URLs in a web application.

- Directory Brute-Forcing
- Used the dirb tool to automate the process of guessing directory and file names on a target web server.

- Command Line Basics for Hacking
- Ran tools from a Linux-based terminal, a common environment for cybersecurity workflows.

Practical Example
# Scan the target for hidden pages
dirb http://fakebank.thm
This command runs dirb against the target URL and checks for commonly used paths that may expose sensitive functionality.

This exercise gave me a foundational understanding of how attackers may begin probing web applications for vulnerabilities. Although it’s a small first step, it has sparked my curiosity to go deeper into:
- Web application exploitation
- Privilege escalation
- Red teaming techniques

I plan to continue with more beginner-friendly rooms on TryHackMe such as:
- OWASP Top 10
- Basic Pentesting
- Linux Fundamentals
